                College: the romantic transition period from high school to work. Right?
                 Every August, as the vacation comes to an end, the media is flooded with images of 18-year-olds and their parents flocking to college campuses, loaded with personal belongings, ready to pack into the Halls.
                  The word “college” tends to make people think of young adults, recently graduated from high school, who will be living in residences on campus, studying with friends, and socializing together on the weekends. 
                  Individuals who have found and been accepted to the College that is the perfect fit for them.
                 Let the magic begin.

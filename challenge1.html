                College: the romantic transition period from high school to work. Right?
                 Every August, as the vacation comes to an end, the media is flooded with images of 18-year-olds and their parents flocking to college campuses, loaded with personal belongings, ready to pack into the Halls.
                  The word “college” tends to make people think of young adults, recently graduated from high school, who will be living in residences on campus, studying with friends, and socializing together on the weekends. 
                  Individuals who have found and been accepted to the College that is the perfect fit for them.
                 Let the magic begin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many young adults will have spent their Vacation preparing for the transition to college. Bedrooms were cleaned, youthfully acquired belongings sorted and downsized, memories revisited and college planning guides for student success read.
                 Transition guides include topics like: 10 things to do to be ready for college; Living in Hostel/Hall; tips for classroom success; shopping for the things you will need in college; college and drinking; staying connected; and dealing with setbacks.
                  All things the young adults need to know before striking out on their own for the first time. 
                The 18 year old, recent high school senior is seen as the “typical” college student.

                  People go to college for a variety of reasons. The type of college you select will help set parameters and expectations for your experiences. 
                  Before jumping into the details of going to college, it’s important to stop and think about the purpose college has in your life.
                   Traditionally, college was a place young adults went after high school to explore courses and majors before settling into a job path.
                   Today, most people generally go to college for one of 5 main reasons:
              </p>
              <li><b>Job Opportunities:</b> A college degree is seen as a minimum qualification for entry into the skilled labor market.
                 Higher education can better prepare you for work, but also increase your flexibility to change jobs and locations.
                 A degree or certificate can act as a springboard for employment.  </li>
                 <li><b> More Money:</b>
                  a degree or certificate may mean greater expertise to an employer and result in higher wages.
                   Investing in a college degree may make it easier to maintain employment in economically challenging times.
                </li>
                <li><b>Learning Things of Interest:</b>  college is a pathway to exploring new studies and finding personal passions leading to alternative career paths.
                </li>
                <li><b>Better Health: </b>Many jobs that require college degrees are less physically demanding in terms of the labor requirements to preform them. In addition, health insurance options may be better through employers.
                </li>

                <p>
                    When choosing a higher education course, think about which subjects interest you, the type of qualification you want and which style of studying suits you best.
                </p>
                <li><b>Choosing your Course:</b>There are a range of subjects and courses available which can help you reach new careers, so it's important to research what's right for you.

                  Many courses are vocational and work-related, and lead straight into a career such as nursing or accountancy. Others are academic and range from subjects you may have studied before in school such as French or geography, to less familiar ones like social policy.
                  
                  You’ll need to look beyond the course title because courses with exactly the same name may differ enormously. You should look carefully at the differences between courses within your subject before deciding which to apply for.
                  
                  For example, if you’re interested in construction but wish to use your creative skills, you may be better suited to a building design management course than a building project management course.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Course differences and entry requirements: </b>  University courses are put together by individual universities and colleges, so what's included and how they are delivered, may vary enormously as they draw on the strengths of the staff and facilities.

                    When choosing your course, you should always be aware of entry requirements. Universities and colleges set their own entry requirements for higher education courses so they may vary widely. 
                    Two or more universities or colleges providing the same course may have different entry requirements so you may have to consider a different route into university or choose a different course if you don't meet their minimum entry requirements.</li>

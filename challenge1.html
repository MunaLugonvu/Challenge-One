          College: the romantic transition period from high school to work. Right?
          Every August, as the vacation comes to an end, the media is flooded with images of 18-year-olds and their
          parents flocking to college campuses, loaded with personal belongings, ready to pack into the Halls.
          The word “college” tends to make people think of young adults, recently graduated from high school, who will
          be living in residences on campus, studying with friends, and socializing together on the weekends.
          Individuals who have found and been accepted to the College that is the perfect fit for them.
          Let the magic begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many young adults will have spent their Vacation preparing for the transition to college. Bedrooms were
          cleaned, youthfully acquired belongings sorted and downsized, memories revisited and college planning guides
          for student success read.
          Transition guides include topics like: 10 things to do to be ready for college; Living in Hostel/Hall; tips
          for classroom success; shopping for the things you will need in college; college and drinking; staying
          connected; and dealing with setbacks.
          All things the young adults need to know before striking out on their own for the first time.
          The 18 year old, recent high school senior is seen as the “typical” college student.

      <header> What is College for?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          People go to college for a variety of reasons. The type of college you select will help set parameters and
          expectations for your experiences.
          Before jumping into the details of going to college, it’s important to stop and think about the purpose
          college has in your life.
          Traditionally, college was a place young adults went after high school to explore courses and majors before
          settling into a job path.
          Today, most people generally go to college for one of 5 main reasons:
        </p>
        <li><b>Job Opportunities:</b> A college degree is seen as a minimum qualification for entry into the skilled
          labor market.
          Higher education can better prepare you for work, but also increase your flexibility to change jobs and
          locations.
          A degree or certificate can act as a springboard for employment. </li>
        <li><b> More Money:</b>
          a degree or certificate may mean greater expertise to an employer and result in higher wages.
          Investing in a college degree may make it easier to maintain employment in economically challenging times.
        </li>
        <li><b>Learning Things of Interest:</b> college is a pathway to exploring new studies and finding personal
          passions leading to alternative career paths.
        </li>
        <li><b>Better Health: </b>Many jobs that require college degrees are less physically demanding in terms of the
          labor requirements to preform them. In addition, health insurance options may be better through employers.
        </li>

        <p>
          When choosing a higher education course, think about which subjects interest you, the type of qualification
          you want and which style of studying suits you best.
        </p>
        <li><b>Choosing your Course:</b>There are a range of subjects and courses available which can help you reach new
          careers, so it's important to research what's right for you.

          Many courses are vocational and work-related, and lead straight into a career such as nursing or accountancy.
          Others are academic and range from subjects you may have studied before in school such as French or geography,
          to less familiar ones like social policy.

          You’ll need to look beyond the course title because courses with exactly the same name may differ enormously.
          You should look carefully at the differences between courses within your subject before deciding which to
          apply for.

          For example, if you’re interested in construction but wish to use your creative skills, you may be better
          suited to a building design management course than a building project management course.
        </li>
        <li><b>Course differences and entry requirements: </b> University courses are put together by individual
          universities and colleges, so what's included and how they are delivered, may vary enormously as they draw on
          the strengths of the staff and facilities.

          When choosing your course, you should always be aware of entry requirements. Universities and colleges set
          their own entry requirements for higher education courses so they may vary widely.
          Two or more universities or colleges providing the same course may have different entry requirements so you
          may have to consider a different route into university or choose a different course if you don't meet their
          minimum entry requirements.</li>
        <p> If you are interested in Programming, Like i am, you might want to consiider courses like Software
          Enginnering, Computer Science or any Language specific courses.</p>

      <header>Dealing With Lecturers</header>
      <article>
        <p> You are going to find teachers, Lectueres, professors and mentors of different kinds at the
          University.You’ve never had a university lecture and you know next to nothing about your lecturers.
          So, who exactly are these strange creatures who will deliver all the information you need to walk away with a
          nice crisp degree in 3 years’ time?</p><br>
        <p>Here are some few Tips</p>
        <li>They will not Chase after You.
          <p>Your university years will give you the opportunity to grow up as a person and as an academic.

            Unfortunately, a big part of growing up is less things are done for you and this applies to lecturers as
            well.

            Whereas at school teachers will monitor your work for signs you need extra help and constantly remind you of
            assignment deadlines, university lecturers will tend not to do this – it will be on you to ask for help or
            to remember key dates.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> You may find your relationships with your lecturers are more distant and transactional.
          <p>Your lecturers might not know your name, they won’t have time to get to know you really well (at least in
            lectures themselves) and they probably won’t notice any time you are absent until they consult the register.

            Do not be mortally offended – this is just a product of having much larger groups and less one-to-one time
            with students. Additionally, lecture content will generally take up the entire time allotted so time for
            more relaxed discussion is very limited.

            University is largely about learning, so see lecture time as the opportunity to gain as much information as
            possible. Relationships with staff can still be built, but you may have to put in more time outside of
            contact hours (e.g. asking for advice in office hours, emailing with queries etc.) to achieve this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> Lecturers do care about you but teaching isn’t their only job</li>
        <li>. A lecturer will take a lot less time showing their PowerPoints</li>

      <header>Programming</header>
      <article>
        <p> Since I am doing Programming I am going to give you a little Insight about it.
          There are a Couple of programmming languages. For example:
        </p>
        <li> Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>C++, C, C Sharp e.t.c</li>
        <p> I am going to focus on Javascript.Like any other programming laguages , In JavaScript we have : Variables,
          Data Types, Constants, If Statements and The Famous "HELLO WORLD"</p>
        <li><b>Variables:</b></li>
        <p> You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p> With the keyword var. For example, <br> <code>var x = 42.</code> <br>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, <br><code>x = 42.</code><br>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.
        </p>
        <p> With the keyword let. For example, <br><code> let y = 13.</code><br>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.

          <li><b>Hello World</b></li>
          <p> To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
            code:<br>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { <br>
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);<br>
                      }<br>
                      greetMe("World");<br>
                      </code><br>

            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

          <li><b>Constants</b></li>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter,
            underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
          </p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to
            be initialized to a value.</p>

          <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
            omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>

          <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
          </p>

          <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR<br>
                        function f() {};<br>
                        const f = 5;<br>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO <br>
                        function f() {<br>
                          const g = 5;<br>
                          var g;<br>
                          //statements<br>
                        }<br>
                      </code>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.<br>
          <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};<br>
                        MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";<br>
                      </code>
      </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="data_Types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript is dynamically typed (also called loosely typed) scripting language. That is, in javascript
          variables can receive different data types over time.
          Datatypes are basically typed of data that can be used and manipulated in a program.

          <p>The latest ECMAScript(ES6) standard defines seven data types: Out of which six data types are
            Primitive(predefined).</p>

          Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.<br>
          String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.<br>
          Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.<br>
          Null: This type has only one value : null.
          Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.<br>
          Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn
          about these data types in details in further articles.<br>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="if_statements">
      <header>If Statements</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
        execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:<br>

        <code>if (condition){ <br>
            statement_1;<br>
          }else {<br>
            statement_2;<br>
          }<br>
          </code>

        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
        evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is
        executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition_1) {<br>
      statement_1;<br>
    } else if (condition_2) {<br>
      statement_2;<br>
    } else if (condition_n) {<br>
      statement_n;<br>
    } else {<br>
      statement_last;<br>
    } </code><br>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To
        execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) .
        In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

        <code>if (condition) {<br>
      statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
      statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
    } else {<br>
      statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
      statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
    }</code><br>
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
        confused with equality when glancing over the code.
        For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) {<br>
      /* statements here */<br>
    }</code><br>
        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses
        around the assignment. For example:

        <code>if ((x = y)) {<br>
      /* statements here */<br>
    }</code><br>

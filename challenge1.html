                College: the romantic transition period from high school to work. Right?
                 Every August, as the vacation comes to an end, the media is flooded with images of 18-year-olds and their parents flocking to college campuses, loaded with personal belongings, ready to pack into the Halls.
                  The word “college” tends to make people think of young adults, recently graduated from high school, who will be living in residences on campus, studying with friends, and socializing together on the weekends. 
                  Individuals who have found and been accepted to the College that is the perfect fit for them.
                 Let the magic begin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many young adults will have spent their Vacation preparing for the transition to college. Bedrooms were cleaned, youthfully acquired belongings sorted and downsized, memories revisited and college planning guides for student success read.
                 Transition guides include topics like: 10 things to do to be ready for college; Living in Hostel/Hall; tips for classroom success; shopping for the things you will need in college; college and drinking; staying connected; and dealing with setbacks.
                  All things the young adults need to know before striking out on their own for the first time. 
                The 18 year old, recent high school senior is seen as the “typical” college student.

              <p>
                  People go to college for a variety of reasons. The type of college you select will help set parameters and expectations for your experiences. 
                  Before jumping into the details of going to college, it’s important to stop and think about the purpose college has in your life.
                   Traditionally, college was a place young adults went after high school to explore courses and majors before settling into a job path.
                   Today, most people generally go to college for one of 5 main reasons:
              </p>
              <li><b>Job Opportunities:</b> A college degree is seen as a minimum qualification for entry into the skilled labor market.
                 Higher education can better prepare you for work, but also increase your flexibility to change jobs and locations.
                 A degree or certificate can act as a springboard for employment.  </li>
                 <li><b> More Money:</b>
                  a degree or certificate may mean greater expertise to an employer and result in higher wages.
                   Investing in a college degree may make it easier to maintain employment in economically challenging times.
                </li>
                <li><b>Learning Things of Interest:</b>  college is a pathway to exploring new studies and finding personal passions leading to alternative career paths.
                </li>
                <li><b>Better Health: </b>Many jobs that require college degrees are less physically demanding in terms of the labor requirements to preform them. In addition, health insurance options may be better through employers.
                </li>

                <p>
                    When choosing a higher education course, think about which subjects interest you, the type of qualification you want and which style of studying suits you best.
                </p>
                <li><b>Choosing your Course:</b>There are a range of subjects and courses available which can help you reach new careers, so it's important to research what's right for you.

                  Many courses are vocational and work-related, and lead straight into a career such as nursing or accountancy. Others are academic and range from subjects you may have studied before in school such as French or geography, to less familiar ones like social policy.
                  
                  You’ll need to look beyond the course title because courses with exactly the same name may differ enormously. You should look carefully at the differences between courses within your subject before deciding which to apply for.
                  
                  For example, if you’re interested in construction but wish to use your creative skills, you may be better suited to a building design management course than a building project management course.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Course differences and entry requirements: </b>  University courses are put together by individual universities and colleges, so what's included and how they are delivered, may vary enormously as they draw on the strengths of the staff and facilities.

                    When choosing your course, you should always be aware of entry requirements. Universities and colleges set their own entry requirements for higher education courses so they may vary widely. 
                    Two or more universities or colleges providing the same course may have different entry requirements so you may have to consider a different route into university or choose a different course if you don't meet their minimum entry requirements.</li>
                    <p>  If you are interested in Programming, Like i am, you might want to consiider courses like Software Enginnering, Computer Science or any Language specific courses.</p>

              <header>Dealing With Lecturers</header>
              <article>
                <p> You are going to find teachers, Lectueres, professors and mentors of different kinds at the University.You’ve never had a university lecture and you know next to nothing about your lecturers. 
                  So, who exactly are these strange creatures who will deliver all the information you need to walk away with a nice crisp degree in 3 years’ time?</p><br>
                  <p>Here are some few Tips</p>
                  <li>They will not Chase after You. 
                    <p>Your university years will give you the opportunity to grow up as a person and as an academic.
                      
                      Unfortunately, a big part of growing up is less things are done for you and this applies to lecturers as well.

                     Whereas at school teachers will monitor your work for signs you need extra help and constantly remind you of assignment deadlines, university lecturers will tend not to do this – it will be on you to ask for help or to remember key dates.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li> You may find your relationships with your lecturers are more distant and transactional.
                    <p>Your lecturers might not know your name, they won’t have time to get to know you really well (at least in lectures themselves) and they probably won’t notice any time you are absent until they consult the register.

                        Do not be mortally offended – this is just a product of having much larger groups and less one-to-one time with students. Additionally, lecture content will generally take up the entire time allotted so time for more relaxed discussion is very limited.
                        
                        University is largely about learning, so see lecture time as the opportunity to gain as much information as possible. Relationships with staff can still be built, but you may have to put in more time outside of contact hours (e.g. asking for advice in office hours, emailing with queries etc.) to achieve this.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li> Lecturers do care about you but teaching isn’t their only job</li>
                  <li>. A lecturer will take a lot less time showing their PowerPoints</li>

                <p> Since I am doing Programming I am going to give you a little Insight about it.
                   There are a Couple of programmming languages. For example:
              </p>
                   <li> Python</li>
                   <li>Java</li>
                   <li>JavaScript</li>
                   <li>C++, C, C Sharp e.t.c</li>
                   <p> I am going to focus on Javascript.Like any other programming laguages , In JavaScript we have : Variables, Data Types, Constants, If Statements and The Famous "HELLO WORLD"</p>
                   <li><b>Variables:</b></li>
                   <p> You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                  <p> With the keyword var. For example, <br> <code>var x = 42.</code> <br>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     By simply assigning it a value. For example, <br><code>x = 42.</code><br> 
                     This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                   </p>
                   <p> With the keyword let. For example, <br><code> let y = 13.</code><br>
                     This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
                     
                   <li><b>Hello World</b></li>
                   <p>  To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br>
                      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { <br>
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);<br>
                      }<br>
                      greetMe("World");<br>
                      </code><br>
                  
                      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
